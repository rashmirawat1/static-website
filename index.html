            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p>In a world where humanity hides behind massive walls to escape man-eating Titans, young Eren Yeager dreams of freedom beyond the barriers. When the Colossal Titan breaches Wall Maria in 845, Eren's hometown is destroyed, and his mother is devoured. Vowing revenge, Eren joins the Survey Corps with childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert. As they uncover secrets about the Titans—including Eren's ability to transform into one—the story expands into a global conflict between Eldians and Marley, revealing cycles of hatred, power, and the Rumbling apocalypse.</p>
